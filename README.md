## <i>Genomec: A Novel Tool for the Statistical Analysis of Genomic Features in Human Samples</i>
## Abstract
Genomec is a bioinformatics tool for the statistical analysis of genomic features (i.e. genes, exons, viruses, phages, microbes, bacteria e.t.c)
 across regions of interest in human disease samples using public datasets by computing the number of blocks (exons) 
in each Browser Extensible Data (BED) line in the sample.
