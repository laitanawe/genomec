# Genomec: A Novel Tool for the Statistical Analysis of Features in Human Diseases
A bioinformatics tool for the statistical analysis of features (i.e. genes, exons, viruses, phages, microbes, bacteria e.t.c)
 across regions of interest in human disease samples using public datasets by computing the number of blocks (exons) 
in each BED line in the sample.
